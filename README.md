This is the code used in the first attempt of making a 3D printer, by me :).
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
So, im a 16 YO student from Colombia that wanted to make a 3D printer from scratch.
Im kind of stuck with the code of Marlin, so I need some help witht that.
in this thing that apparently is called a repository you will find the code that I have tried make work.
The version is marlin 1.9.1.1 and I am using rampsm 1.4.
The usable bed size is: (160mm,205mm) as I explained previously in the video, thought the original bed size is (220mm,220mm)
In this repository I will upload:
*Marlin code.
*Diagram

If you want to contact me this is my email: fgutep@gmail.com
Any help will be much apreciated.
Thank you very much.
